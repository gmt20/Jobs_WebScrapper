# Jobs_WebScrapper
This is a web scrppper written in python using BeautifulSoup which gathers the latest 20 jobs update from a job portal and sends an email update to the specified email id.

I am intend to build a chrome extension to take input from user(job_name, job_location, state, email address ) and use this python webscrapper in the back end to scrape the data.
